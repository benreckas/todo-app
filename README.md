# Lister

Lister is a to-do list application built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JaveScript. No framworks added. It utilizes CRUD functionality to maintain a list of to-do items. This was my first project built using JavaScript, so I experimented a lot with the language to learn about its syntax and quirks. You can see Lister in action [here](https://benreckas.github.io/todo-app/).
